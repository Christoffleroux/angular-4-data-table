## Angular 5 Data Table

It is fork of this [package](https://github.com/MIt9/angular-4-data-table).

A simple Angular 5 data table, with built-in solutions for features including:
* pagination
* sorting
* row selection (single/multi)
* expandable rows
* column resizing
* selecting visible columns
* accessibility (basic)

It's based on Bootstrap 4 and Font Awesome, so you need to include them in the application using it.

The component can be used not just with local data, but remote resources too: for example if the sorting and paging happen in the database.
